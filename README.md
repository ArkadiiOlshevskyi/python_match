# Python "match" feature for Processing Patterns and Matching Data

![python_match_img](https://github.com/ArkadiiOlshevskyi/python_match/blob/main/img/match_python.png?raw=true)

This README explores Python's powerful "match" feature, introduced in Python 3.11. This feature offers advanced pattern matching capabilities, enabling developers to efficiently process and match various types of data. In this document, we'll dive into diverse use cases to help you harness the full potential of the "match" functionality.

## Examples

### 1. Process Data Source
Leverage the match pattern to effectively track and categorize file types such as JSON, XML, CSV, and more. By parsing files within a designated folder, automate the process of identifying various file formats and executing specific actions accordingly.

### 2. Matching Data in Lists, Dicts, Arrays, and Tuples
Demonstrating the versatility of the match pattern, dive into examples involving different data structures such as lists, dictionaries, arrays, and tuples. By applying pattern matching to these structures, efficiently extract, transform, or process specific elements based on predefined patterns.

### 3. Monitor Data Quality
The match pattern can be used to assess and ensure the quality of incoming data. While the specifics depend on your use case, the match feature allows you to easily identify data patterns that deviate from the expected norm, triggering appropriate actions or alerts.

### 4. Match for Classes and Objects
Explore how the match pattern can enhance object-oriented programming by creating classes and associated objects. By employing pattern matching, efficiently filter and extract objects that satisfy certain criteria, enabling targeted and dynamic manipulations within our program.

### 5. Traffic Light Switcher and Pedestrian
Imagine implementing a traffic light system using the match feature. Through a continuous loop, the lights alternate between red, yellow, and green. The loop only breaks when a user inputs 'S' in the terminal, pausing the cycle for 10 seconds to allow pedestrians to cross. By matching commands like 'S', 'stop', or 'pause', synchronize user input with the functioning of the lights.

### 6. Function Calling
Discover how the match pattern can trigger function calls within a Django e-commerce application. For instance, when a user initiates a "checkout" action, the match pattern can seamlessly direct the user to the checkout page. Similarly, interactions like "add to cart" can be handled through the appropriate functions.

### 7. Handle Server Response
Simulate a 24/7 server operation using a continuous loop. By sending POST requests to the server and receiving responses, apply the match pattern to efficiently categorize and process the different types of server responses. This allows focusing on tracking only specific response categories, such as success (200 OK), redirects (300), client errors (400), and server errors (500).

### 8. Process Event - User Behavior
Harness the power of the match pattern to analyze and respond to user behavior in a Django web service. By defining patterns that capture different types of user interactions or events, tailor application responses to specific scenarios or triggers.

### 9. Match Usernames, Emails, and Passwords
Create a dictionary containing user information, including usernames, email addresses, and passwords. Through terminal input, users can provide their credentials, and the match pattern will facilitate a comparison with the stored data, enabling authentication and access control.

### 10. Matching PIN entering
In this authentication process, users input a numerical pin via the terminal, which is then compared against a dataset of 10 valid pins consisting only of digits. Successful matching grants access, while discrepancies result in denied login attempts. Balancing user convenience with security, this method ensures straightforward yet secure user authentication
